# Contributing

This repository exists to automate the preferences found in our [Open Source](https://github.com/Wall-Brew-Co/open-source#preferences) policy.
It acts as a single point-of-truth for linter and formatter configuration, or automated quality checks, and community documentation templates.
Since each of these items is internally maintained or reflective of our relationship with our contributors, this repository is generally not open for public contribution.
Minor bug fixes, spelling corrections, or technical improvements _may be applied_; however, these should be considered the exception.
